## Summary :memo:
I'm a QA Engineer with over 10 years in technical support and three years in quality assurance. I've spent most of my career working for SAAS startups.   

I'm skilled at troubleshooting, running tests, and working closely with development teams to improve product quality. I aim to make tech more accessible for users while keeping everything running as it should.   

I'm passionate about continuous improvement. I'm always looking for ways to streamline processes and make software more reliable.   

Whether solving technical problems or refining testing workflows, I focus on delivering user-friendly solutions that meet the highest quality standards.
