## Summary :memo:
I'm a software technical support and QA specialist with over 10 years of experience, between troubleshooting issues and ensuring smooth software performance. The bulk of my experience has been in SAAS startups.   

I'm skilled at troubleshooting, running tests, and working closely with development teams to improve product quality. I aim to make tech more accessible for users while keeping everything running as it should.   

I'm passionate about continuous improvement. I'm always looking for ways to streamline processes and make software more reliable.   

Whether solving technical problems or refining testing workflows, I focus on delivering user-friendly solutions that meet the highest quality standards.

## Experience :briefcase:
At my last workplace, Thought Industries, I advanced from Product Support to Quality Assurance. Three years on the support team helped me become a subject matter expert on our eLearning platform. Additionally, I took pride in writing complete, precise, easy-to-follow bug reports for our development team, which set me off to a great start in QA.   

Before my time at TI, I worked in a fast-paced call center for LevelUp, a food ordering app. I assisted vendors and end-users on both sides of the food-ordering transaction via phone, chat, and email.   

Before LevelUp, I worked at MeYou Health, a small SAAS startup that provided a wellness platform for workplaces and insurance companies. My team and I provided customer support for apps that got people walking, encouraged healthy actions, and helped people quit smoking. As the inaugural support team member, I set up our initial processes and scaled them up as the customer base and product suite grew.   

In 2011, I began my career in SAAS, working at Hubspot. There, I meticulously helped end-users make the most of a fully featured (often overwhelming) marketing suite.   

I worked in several eclectic positions before I moved into the jobs documented on my resume. I've error-checked credentialling forms for insurance companies, moderated massive multiplayer online games, ensured passenger safety and comfort as a flight attendant, stocked greeting cards in retail stores, built and repaired computers, and worked behind many, many cash registers.
